## Initiative 1: Create Interactive Gallery Page

### Description
An interactive gallery page is an effective way for learners to explore different photography techniques and settings. This initiative involves designing and developing an interactive gallery page that displays a collection of images and allows learners to adjust the camera settings to see how they affect the final image.

### Epic
**Design Interactive Gallery Page:** This epic involves designing the user interface for the interactive gallery page, including the layout of the images, controls for adjusting camera settings, and other interactive features.

### Test Plan
1. **Image Selection:** Test the success of the gallery page by selecting a range of images with different settings and ensuring that they are displayed correctly on the page.
2. **Interactive Features:** Test the success of the interactive features by allowing learners to adjust the camera settings and see how they affect the final image. Monitor learner feedback to identify areas for improvement.
3. **Overall Functionality:** Test the overall functionality of the gallery page by ensuring that it loads quickly and is easy to navigate. Monitor learner feedback to identify areas for improvement.

### Risks
1. Technical Issues: Risks associated with poor internet connectivity, server crashes, or software malfunction.
2. Limited Pictures: Risks associated with inadequate marketing or offering of pictures to display to users
3. Technical Requirements: Risks associated with the potential limitation of audience due to lack of necessary equipment or technical know-how.

### Milestone Target
1. Integration of Gallery page - 3 weeks
2. Integration of feedback communication page - 3 weeks
